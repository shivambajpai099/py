Terrorism World.
Terrorism has emerged as a major threat to the unity and integrity of India. The masterminds of terror seek to achieve their objectives by creating an atmosphere of fear with a view to destabilise India. The major regions affected by terrorist activities in India include Jammu and Kashmir, east-central and south-central India (Naxalism) and the Seven Sisters (North-East). Unemployment has been one of the major causes due to which terrorist groups lure the young generation easily by providing them hoards of easy money. In return, the youngsters have to spread hatred, and indulge in bloodbath and killings on the street. Poverty stricken young people belonging to poor socio-economic background are the ultimate target of the ISI, as they get easily influenced to do their bidding in return of easy money. India has already been ranked among the top ten terrorism affected countries in the world. Apart from radical terrorism affected states such as Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Tripura, Assam, Nagaland and Manipur, there are other states which have been victims of Naxalite terrorism, which emanated from Naxalbari village in West Bengal through a movement by the landless against the land owners of that village. This movement soon spread across the country. Currently, there are various terrorist organisations operating in the country in a clandestine manner with their members hard to be recognised. The authorities have established their links with various international terrorism organisations most of which are being operated on a global level to supply arms, ammunition in different countries to destabilise the nation. Poverty and unemployment are among the major reasons fuelling the growth of terrorism in India. If we want to curb terrorism, we are required to address the causes which have given rise to radicalisation of youth in different parts of the country.
